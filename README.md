# Melee-X

Super Smash Bros. Melee running natively on an original Xbox.

This isn't an emulator. The [doldecomp](https://github.com/doldecomp/melee) project turned Melee back into C source, and Melee-X compiles that code for the Xbox's 733 MHz Pentium III. Every frame is drawn by the Xbox's own NV2A GPU through a GameCube graphics layer written for it, and the game data streams from your disc image the same way it would from a GameCube disc.

**Status:** fully playable. Matches usually run somewhere between 30 and 60 fps depending on the stage and how much is going on, menus sit at 60, and the game itself always ticks at full speed. It's still in development, so a crash can happen, but it's unlikely.

- 4 players on the 4 controller ports, with rumble
- 480i or 480p, 4:3 or 16:9, picked from your dashboard's video settings. Tested on composite and on component cables to an HDTV
- 720p when your dashboard has it turned on. It's sharp and holds up well now, though busy stages still dip below 60. Hold **Back** while Melee-X starts if your TV ever shows nothing, and you'll get 480i
- A settings menu right on the title screen: press **Back** there (more below)
- Hold L + R + Back + Black to quit back to the dashboard
- The Xbox's front light joins in: it flashes in a player's colour when they lose a stock, counts down the last seconds of a timed match and goes wild on GAME!
- Saves use the GameCube `.gci` format, so your Dolphin or memory card save works here and the other way around

You need your own copy of the game. Nothing from Nintendo ships with this.

The Xbox side grew out of [OpenCrossing-Xbox](https://github.com/GabeConway/OpenCrossing-Xbox), my Animal Crossing port.

## What you need

- A modded original Xbox (softmod or modchip) that runs homebrew. A stock 64 MB console is fine. On a console upgraded to 128 MB, Melee-X uses only 64 MB unless you turn on `ram128` (see Settings).
- A way to copy files to it. Usually that's FTP from your dashboard (UnleashX, XBMC4Gamers, EvolutionX and friends all have a server built in).
- A disc image of **Super Smash Bros. Melee, NTSC-U, version 1.02** (game ID `GALE01`, revision 2), dumped from your own disc. `.iso`, `.gcm` and `.ciso` all work, and the filename doesn't matter. PAL and Japanese copies won't boot. The 1.00 and 1.01 revisions start, but only 1.02 has been tested.
- A controller. The Duke and the Controller S both work.

## Download

Grab the newest `Melee-X-<version>.zip` from the [Releases](../../releases) page and unzip it:

```
Melee-X/
  default.xbe      the game
  default.tbn      dashboard icon
tools/
  make-xiso        packs the game and your disc image into a burnable ISO
```

Then pick how you want to play.

## Option 1: install to the hard drive

Easiest, and it loads the fastest.

1. Drop your Melee disc image into the `Melee-X` folder, right next to `default.xbe`.
2. Connect to your Xbox with an FTP client like FileZilla. Your dashboard shows the Xbox's IP address, and the login on most dashboards is `xbox` / `xbox`.
3. Copy the whole `Melee-X` folder to wherever your dashboard looks for apps or games, for example `F:\Applications\` or `E:\Games\`.
4. Launch Melee-X from the dashboard. You should see the orange X icon.

When you're done it looks like this:

```
F:\Applications\Melee-X\
  default.xbe
  default.tbn
  Melee.iso        (yours, any name)
```

The image is about 1.4 GB, so give the copy a minute.

## Option 2: burn a disc

This packs `default.xbe` and your disc image into one Xbox disc image. Melee's files fill most of the GameCube disc, so the result is around 1.4 GB and needs a **DVD-R** (a CD-R is too small).

1. Get [xdvdfs](https://github.com/antangelo/xdvdfs/releases). On Windows just download the `.exe` from its releases page.
2. Build the ISO. Either way works:
   - With the script, from Git Bash, WSL, Linux or macOS (needs `xdvdfs` on your PATH):

     ```sh
     tools/make-xiso Melee-X "Melee.iso" Melee-X.iso
     ```

   - By hand: put your disc image in the `Melee-X` folder like in Option 1, then run `xdvdfs pack Melee-X Melee-X.iso`.
3. Burn `Melee-X.iso` to a DVD-R at a low speed with something like ImgBurn. Burn it as an image, don't let the burner convert it.
4. Put the disc in your modded Xbox and start it from the dashboard's disc option.

Not every Xbox DVD drive likes burned discs. Samsung drives are usually the most forgiving and Thomson drives the least. If yours won't read it, go with Option 1.

## Option 3: xemu

Build the ISO from Option 2, then load it in [xemu](https://xemu.app) with Machine > Load Disc. Set xemu's memory to 64 MB. It runs, but slower than a real Xbox, since xemu has to emulate the GPU.

## Saves

Saves always go to the hard drive, even when you play from a disc. They live in `E:\UDATA\4d580001\card_a\` as normal GameCube `.gci` files.

To bring over a save from Dolphin or a real memory card:

1. Export it as a `.gci`. Dolphin's memory card manager does this, and GCI tools can pull one off a real card.
2. Launch Melee-X once so it makes its folders.
3. FTP the `.gci` into `E:\UDATA\4d580001\card_a\`.

Going the other way works too: copy the `.gci` off the Xbox and import it into Dolphin.

## Video modes, the short version

Your dashboard decides what your TV and cables can handle. Melee-X never goes past what the dashboard allows, it can only pick something lower.

- **480i** works on everything, composite included. This is what you get if the dashboard has 480p turned off.
- **480p** needs component cables (or a VGA/HDMI adapter) and 480p turned on in the dashboard. Sharper, and the best way to play right now.
- **720p** needs component cables and 720p turned on in the dashboard. Melee-X uses it whenever the dashboard allows it. It's the sharpest option; busy stages dip below 60 there, a bit more than at 480.
- **Widescreen** shows more of the stage left and right instead of stretching it. Set widescreen in the dashboard and leave it on in Melee-X. 720p is always widescreen.

If you pick something in the menu that your dashboard doesn't allow, the menu tells you what you'll actually get, like `480p -> 480i`.

**Black screen?** Some TVs don't show 720p even when the dashboard has it turned on. Hold **Back** on any controller while Melee-X starts (the loading screen says so). That boot comes up in 480i, which every TV shows, and it switches 720p and 480p off in your settings so it stays that way. Turn them back on in the menu whenever you like.

## Settings menu

Press **Back** on the title screen ("Press Start") and the settings menu opens. Up and down pick a row, left and right (or A) change it, and B saves and closes.

| option | what it does |
|---|---|
| Video output | 480i, 480p or 720p. Takes effect after a restart |
| Widescreen (16:9) | 16:9 at 480i/480p when the dashboard is set to widescreen. After a restart |
| Frame-rate counter | shows the fps in the top left corner, right away |
| BACK screenshots | when on, pressing Back saves a screenshot (`shotNN.bmp`) next to your settings. Handy for bug reports |
| Front LED effects | the front light flashes on KOs, in the last seconds and on GAME!. Off by default. If something else controls your front LED, such as a Kronos modchip, it's best to leave this off |
| Use 128 MB RAM | only for consoles upgraded to 128 MB. On a stock 64 MB Xbox it's locked off, so you can't break anything |
| Rumble | off, or 25% to 100% |
| Controller, dead zones, trigger click | pick a port, then set its stick dead zones and how far the triggers go in before they count as a full press |
| Save and restart | saves and relaunches Melee-X, so video changes kick in |

Anything that needs a restart gets a `*` next to it. Button remapping isn't in the menu yet, that's still done in the file below.

## Settings file

Everything the menu changes lives in `E:\UDATA\4d580001\settings.ini`, and you can edit it over FTP too. Melee-X writes it the first time it boots. Delete it if you ever want to go back to the defaults.

| section | setting | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `[video]` | `720p` | 1 (the default) uses 720p when your dashboard has it turned on (needs component cables); otherwise you get 480p or 480i. 0 sticks to 480 |
| | `progressive` | 0 forces 480i even when your dashboard allows 480p |
| | `widescreen` | 1 draws 16:9 at 480i/480p when the dashboard is set to widescreen |
| | `fps` | 1 shows a frame counter in the top left corner (off by default) |
| `[system]` | `ram128` | 1 lets a console upgraded to 128 MB use all of it. Off by default: Melee-X then runs in the first 64 MB, the setup it was tested on. Ignored on a 64 MB console |
| | `screenshots` | 1 makes Back save a screenshot (`shotNN.bmp` in the same folder) |
| | `led_effects` | 1 lets matches play with the front light; 0 (the default) leaves it to the Xbox. Older files' `led` line is ignored |
| `[input]` | `rumble` | rumble strength in percent, 0 turns it off |
| `[port1]` to `[port4]` | `stick_deadzone`, `cstick_deadzone` | stick dead zones in percent |
| | `trigger_click` | how far (0-255) a trigger goes in before it counts as a full L/R press |
| | `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `white`, `black`, ... | button mapping, written as `xbox button = GameCube button` |

## Controls

| Xbox | GameCube |
|---|---|
| A | A |
| X | B |
| B | X |
| Y | Y |
| White or Black | Z |
| Left / right trigger | L / R (analog) |
| Left stick | control stick |
| Right stick | C-stick |
| D-pad | D-pad |
| Start | Start |

The layout matches where the buttons sit on a GameCube pad. Every port can be remapped in `settings.ini`.

Hold **L + R + Back + Black** on any controller to quit to the dashboard.

## If something breaks

Logs go to `E:\UDATA\4d580001\`: `boot.log` always, `boot_prev.log` from the launch before that, plus `crash.log` or `hang.log` if it went wrong. Attach those (and a photo if the screen showed an error) when you open an issue. If something looks wrong rather than crashing, turn on BACK screenshots in the settings menu and press Back when you see it.

Settings, saves and screenshots all live on E:. If E: is full, Melee-X tells you on screen, keeps your last save as it was and writes `boot.log` next to `default.xbe` instead. Free some space on E: and launch again.

## Building it yourself

The short version: nxdk and LLVM 21, built either in Docker or natively on Windows with MSYS2.

```sh
tools/xbox/msys/build.sh          # Windows, MSYS2
tools/xbox/docker/build.sh        # Docker (Linux, macOS, Windows)
```

Both write `build-xbox/xbe/default.xbe`. The setup, the tests and how the port works are in [docs/](docs/README.md), starting with [docs/toolchain.md](docs/toolchain.md) and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
